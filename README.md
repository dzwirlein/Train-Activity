# Train-Activity


A functioning app which uses firebase, css, html, javascript, and moment.js to display user entered train times. The application takes in user input and saves that data to a firebase database. The data is then taken from the database and formated correctly using jquery and moment.js. Finally, the data is then displayed on the page showing the user when the name of the train, the frequency of arrival, the next arrival, and the amount of time until the next arrival.
